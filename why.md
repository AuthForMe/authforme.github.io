# The Internet Doesn't Work (for Humans)

The internet was built as a way for humans to share and access information with each other. And it became so much more. Many of us alive today can't imagine a world without the worldwide web. 

But with all the convenience and access that it brings, the internet has introduced a new set of problems in our lives. As the internet evolves and becomes more important in our lives, these problems grow, too. Let's break down a few.

## Your Security 

According to Dashlane, [The Average Person in the US has 130 password-protected intenet accounts](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/uncovering-password-habits-are-users-password-security-habits-improving-infographic). That study was from 2015, and we can imagine the numbers have grown. To protect our security, we're expected to create a unique, secure, and unguessable password for each account. Because that's impossible, we just don't. For the tech savvy, we use a browser plugin or a secure "password keeper". For the rest, we write it in a notepad and shove it in a drawer.

Passwords can help deter casual attackers. But an attacker with a budget can crack most of our passwords in a few minutes. As computers get faster, our passwords are easier to crack. The answer is not to create longer, harder passwords. We need to rethink how internet security can work for humans.

## Your Privacy

Many of us have reluctantly accepted that in certain areas of the internet, we can not expect privacy of our data. Facebook has had so many data breaches and accidental releases of user information, it's hard to even know how much of our data is out there. These breaches seem to happen more and more often, and they effect more people.

There's a booming industry of tech companies that help you recover from these leaks, and protect your identity, after your information is leaked. While the people operating these websites try to make them more secure, it's a losing game. 

We need to rethink our private information, and about what websites we chose to trust with our data.


## Your Attention

Most of us have heard, "If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold." While sad, this is a fundamental truth about how the internet works for businesses today. Every website you visit wants to sell you something. If you're not paying for a product, some advertiser is paying to show you an ad. If you scroll through Instagram or Facebook, every 4th post is an ad. These platforms are addictive, in large part because they have teams of scientists trying to keep you active on their website for as long as possibe. 

We need to rethink how we protect our attention.
